# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a machine learning solution for predicting passenger survival on the Titanic, based on data from the famous Kaggle competition: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).

## 📚 Overview

The notebook walks through the full machine learning pipeline:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training using various algorithms
- Model evaluation
- Submission file generation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset

- `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle.
- Make sure to download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and place it in the same directory as the notebook.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Download the Titanic dataset (`train.csv`, `test.csv`) from Kaggle and place them in the working directory.
3. Install the required Python libraries (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
